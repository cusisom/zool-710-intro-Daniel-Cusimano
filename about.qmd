My name is Daniel (Danny) Cusimano. I grew up in Southern California, sterotypically spending much of my youth at the beach. I moved to the Bay Area when I was accepted into the Anthropology program at Sonoma State University. It was here that I developed my interest in Human Osteology and Paleoanthropology.
