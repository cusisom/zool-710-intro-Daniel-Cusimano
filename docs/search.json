I grew up in Southern California, sterotypically spending much of my youth at the beach. I moved to the Bay Area when I was accepted into the Anthropology program at Sonoma State University. It was here that I developed my interest in Human Osteology and Paleoanthropology."

    "text": "Welcome to Bebop Paleo. This site will act as my hub for storing and displaying information pertaining to my dissertation work in Paleoanthropology.\n\nPaleoanthropology is the study of human fossils and evolution. Like many disciplines that include discussions of phylogeney, there is ongoing debate in my field regarding how certain taxa and individual specimens are classified. My current research works to add to this discussion by quantifying the degree of cranial variation observed in Upper Paleolithic modern humans and using this data to establish parameters for analysis of anatomical distance between late Middle Pleistocene hominin remains. With this, I expect to provide evidence for a highly variable and less speciose hominin population in the late Middle Pleistocene of East Asia.\n\nTo learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap of East Asian Late Middle Pleistocene Localities (~350-70 ka).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dali skull represents a classic Archaic hominin specimen from East Asia, dating between 267-258 ka. It comes from the site of Dali represented by the number one on the map to the left. There is current debate about it’s species status (Wu and Athreya, 2013).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nWu, X., Athreya, S., 2013.
